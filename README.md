EV Charging Station Placement Optimization (AI-Based)

Overview

This project optimizes the placement of EV (Electric Vehicle) charging stations using AI-based techniques, ensuring maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Features

Traffic & Demand Analysis: Uses AI to predict EV demand based on traffic flow.

Geospatial Analysis: Factors in road networks, existing stations, and power grid availability.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes clustering (K-Means) and reinforcement learning for optimal placement.

Cost & Energy Optimization: Balances installation costs with energy availability.

Installation

Prerequisites:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn geopy

Implementation

The project follows these steps:

Data Collection: Traffic, grid data, and user demand are gathered.

Clustering Algorithm: K-Means is used to identify optimal charging locations.

Grid & Cost Constraints: Reinforcement learning optimizes final placements.

Evaluation: The model is tested with real-world datasets.

Usage

Run the Python script to get optimized charging station locations:

python optimize_stations.py
